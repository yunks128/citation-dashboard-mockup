## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **Tailwind CSS v3.4.17**
- **Vanilla JavaScript**
- **React (compiled to JS bundle)** — if applicable
- **Parcel/Webpack/Vite** — if used for bundling (adjust based on actual setup)

## 📦 Getting Started

This is a static build. You can run it locally or deploy it to any static hosting provider (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).

### 1. Serve Locally

If you want to test it locally:

```bash
npx serve citation-dashboard-mockup
````

or use Python:

```bash
cd citation-dashboard-mockup
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then visit: `http://localhost:8080`

### 2. Deployment

Upload the `citation-dashboard-mockup/` folder to your static host. Ensure all relative paths are preserved.

### 3. Modify the Dashboard

Edit:

* `index.html` for layout/markup
* `static/css/main.2f74513b.css` if you wish to override styles (ideally using Tailwind build tools)
* `static/js/main.9bd8bca9.js` to customize logic or data fetch mechanisms
