# RAPID Citation Dashboard

![Dashboard Preview](https://via.placeholder.com/800x450?text=RAPID+Citation+Dashboard)

## Overview

An interactive visualization dashboard for tracking and analyzing citation metrics for the RAPID (River Application for Parallel computation of Discharge) hydrological model. This dashboard provides comprehensive insights into citation patterns, research impact, and comparative analysis against other hydrological models.

## Features

- **Citation Trends**: Track annual and cumulative citations over time
- **Research Domain Analysis**: Visualize distribution across different research fields
- **Engagement Levels**: Analyze how deeply RAPID is being utilized in research
- **Comparative Assessment**: Compare RAPID against other popular hydrological models
- **Future Projections**: View citation growth forecasts and emerging research directions
- **GitHub Metrics**: Monitor repository activity and community engagement

## Live Demo

The dashboard is available at: [https://yunks128.github.io/citation-dashboard-mockup](https://yunks128.github.io/citation-dashboard-mockup)

## Technologies Used
